# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

I used AI (ChatGPT) only a few times, first to help clone the project to my GitHub and set it to connect only my repository.
Second time to figure out how to get the loanToNextAllowed() method to work. At first I tried an enhanced for-loop, but got an error. As ChatGPT explained, it was a ConcurrentModificationException because I tried to change the collection I was iterating. ChatGPT suggested using an Iterator and iterator.remove() instead.

I intentionally didn't want to use AI for quick results, to gain more knowledge by myself. Totally it took about 6-8 hours.
